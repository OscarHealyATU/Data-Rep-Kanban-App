Introduction

A Kanban style task/ note management CRUD App that uses the MERN stack. 
The user will be able to create simple and easy to manage tasks each with a title & description.  

When creating tasks users may select a date for the deadline, and choose whether the task's priority progresses prior to the deadline.
the user may delete the task or progress the task as needed.

additionally the app has an archive feature allowing the user to search all previously completed tasks 
The users will be queried upon completion of a task where they can rate how well the task went and whether they felt it was late or not.
This questionaire will translate to statistic tracking via a pie chart and a percentage rating of how often a user felt a task was completed late vs how often the task missed its deadline.
